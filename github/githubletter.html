	<h2>Let me start with all the reasons I love you...</h2>
		
		<p>You keep me organized. You don't ever hold me down to my first commit. 
		</p>

		</br>

		<p>Speaking of commitment.... if I ever need to go back to the way things were,
		it's only a matter of a few words and you take me back as if nothing happened in the first place. I can go back, move forward, or stay exactly where I am with you.</p>

		</br>
		
		<h2>You are flexible and dynamic.</h2>
		
		<p>I can set up repositories, little databases, by using you. You store all my thoughts, designs, crazy ideas.</p>

			<h3>First you need to make sure Git is installed on my computer. If not go <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">here.</a></h3>

</br>

			<h3>Once I have everything up and running, I go to <a href="https://github.com/">Github.</a></h3>

			<p>On this site, I can manage all my repositories. I can create new ones, configure existing ones, and delete files if I need to. This platform allows me to open source my code on a timeline. Anyone on the web can visit my code and see what I have been creating and shifting (well, according to your pivacy settings and if you pay for a private account)</p>

</br>
			<h3>With the help of Terminal and Git commands, I gain technical knowledge that will help in any web development projects I encounter.</h3>
			<p>To see all the commands thus far I have learned about and used please see my <a href="https://placehold.it"> Git Love Letter</a></p>
