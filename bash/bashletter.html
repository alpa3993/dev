		<h2 class="centerme">Bash, you and Terminal open up the world for me.</h2>
		<p class="centerme">With your help I can see things in a new way. You give me the power to control my computer in ways I didn't know before.
		I know I mostly see your shell but in time I hope to know you on a more deeper level.</p>

		<h2 class="centerme"> But before that, lets start with a little ground rules. </h2>
		<ul class="box centerme">
		<li>You are a man of a few characters - 255 to be exact.</li>
		<li>You mostly only understand A-Z, a-z, 0-9, periods, underscores, and hyphens.</li>
		<li>Underscores are better with you than spaces... since spaces seem to confuse you.</li>
		<li>You give me that "stick shift kind of control" that I need in my life.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="centerme"> In the short time I've known you this is what I've come to know...</h2>
		<ul class="box centerme">
		<li><strong class="command">echo "quote"</strong> - This makes you pull a Polly want a cracker on me</li>
		<li><strong class="command">banner -w# "quote"</strong> - This blows up your Polly want a cracker to the entered pixel amount.</li>
		<li><strong class="command">pwd</strong> - This allows me to see where I am in my system.</li>
		<li><strong class="command">ls</strong> - This commands you to show me a list of all the items in my current directory.</li>
		<li><strong class="command">cd "nameofdirectory"</strong> - this allows me to switch into a specified directory</li>
		<li><strong class="command">cd ..</strong> - this takes me into the parent directory of my current directory</li>	
		<li><strong class="command">cd ~</strong> - this brings me back to the main directory</li>	
		<li><strong class="command">cd /</strong> - this brings me back to the root of my computer</li>
		<li><strong class="command">mkdir "newfilename"</strong> - this will create a new file or directory within my system</li>
		<li><strong class="command">touch "filename" </strong> - this will create a file under whatever name I specify</li>
		<li><strong class="command">nano "filename" </strong> - this allows me to enter into a text editor to write code for the specified file</li>
		<li><strong class="command">q</strong> - this will quit out of all file windows  </li>

<h2 class="centerme">You are always so helpful, not only do you organize my local files, you can upload them and organize them on the server in just a few short commands.... it might be a little bit of a love triangle between you, our secure shell, and myself... but whatever gets the job done is fine with me.</h2>

<ul class="box centerme">
	<li>First I open up Terminal and my secure shell, or SSH.</li>
	<li>Left side will be my local file that I intend to upload while on the right will be our secure shell, or ssh.</li>
	<li>Type <strong>yes</strong></li>
	<li>Enter password</li>
	<li>Get into the directory you would like to upload</li>
	<li>Jump back to local and send to server</li>
	<li><strong>scp</strong> filename alpa3993@creative.colorado.edu:public_html/dev/filenameinfolder</li>
